Topics Covered: `For-loop`  `while-loop`  `Do-while-loop`  `Nested Loop` and also  Understanding and using for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.  Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once . Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems. Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops    | 
| 5 | Functions | Understanding and define `functions` using `function declaration `, `expressions` and `arrow functions`. use `function parameters` and `default values` effectively. create and utilize `higher-order` functions. Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations. Enhances `code reusability` and organization using functions.   | 
| 6 | Array | Understanding Array creation and access Array method using `push`, `pop` , `shift` , `unshift` , `map` , `filter`,`reduce` . Array Iteration using  `for loop` , ` forEach loop`.  Multi-dimensional array Creating and access nested array.  | 
| 7 | Objects | Create and manipulate `objects` with properties and methods , Understand and use the `this` keyword in object methods. Work with `nested objects` and `arrays of objects`. Iterate over an objects properties using `loops` and `built-in methoods`.  | 
| 8 | ES6+ Features | Understanding Objects in JavaScript.  `Template literals` and `string interpolation`. `Multi-line strings`.  `Destructuring` to extract values from arrays and objects.Spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments. `Functions` with `default parameters`. Enhanced `object literals`, including methods and computed property names     | 
| 9 | DOM Manipulation and Events  | Today I learn to  Select and manipulate `DOM elements` using `JavaScript`. Create and append `new elements` to the `DOM`. `Remove elements` from the `DOM`.  Modify attributes and classes of `HTML elements`. Add and `handle events` to make `web pages interactive`. | 
| 10 | Event Handling | Today, I learned about `DOM Manipulation` and `Events` in JavaScript. I practiced selecting and manipulating DOM elements, `creating` and `appending` new elements, and `removing` elements from the `DOM`. I also learned how to modify `attributes` and `classes` of `HTML elements` to enhance interactivity. Additionally, I explored how to add and handle basic events such as `click`, `double click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `keydown`, and `keyup`. I gained an understanding of handling `form events` and implemented event delegation to manage events on dynamically added elements. Overall, I focused on making web pages interactive by responding to various user actions, which is a crucial skill for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications.      | 
| 11 | Promise and Async:Await |Today, I learned about handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. I created and managed `promises`, including resolved and rejected states, and chained multiple promises for sequential operations. I used `async/await` for more readable code, `fetched data` from public APIs, and managed multiple concurrent `promises` with `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`. | 
| 12 | Error Handling |Today, I learned about `error handling` in JavaScript. I implemented basic error handling using `try-catch blocks` and used `finally block` to execute code regardless of the try-catch outcome. I created and used `custom error classes`, handled errors in `promises` using `.catch()` and within `async function` using try-catch, and implemented graceful error handling when making network requests with the `fetch API`.| 
| 13 | Modules | Today, I learned to create and export `functions`, `objects`, and `constants` using `modules` in JavaScript. I practiced importing modules using both `named` and `default` imports and explored using `third-party modules` installed via `npm`. Additionally, I gained an understanding of the basics of `module bundling`. | 
| 14 | CLASSES |Today, I learned to define and use `classes` with `properties` and `methods`. I implemented `inheritance` to `extend` `classes`, utilized `static methods `and properties, applied `getters` and `setters` for `encapsulation`, and understood and used `private fields` in classes. | 
| 15 | CLOSURES |Today, I learned to understand and create `closures` in JavaScript. I used closures to maintain `private state` and create `encapsulated` modules, applied closures in practical scenarios like generating unique IDs and memoization, and used closures in `loops` to capture and use `variables` correctly. | 
| 16 | Recursion |Today, I learned to understand and implement basic `recursion`. I applied recursion to solve problems with `arrays` and `strings`, used recursion for searching and counting elements in arrays, and performed `tree traversal` and calculated `tree depth` using recursion. | 
| 17 | Data Structures | Today, I learned to implement and use `linked lists` for dynamic data storage. I used `stacks` for LIFO operations and reversing data, queues for FIFO operations to simulate real-world scenarios, and implemented `binary trees` for hierarchical data storage and traversal. | 
| 18 | Algorithms |Today, I learned to implement and understand common `sorting` and `searching` algorithms. I also solved `string manipulation` problems using algorithms and performed `array operations` using various algorithms. | 
| 19 | Regular Expression |Today, I learned to understand and create basic  `regular expressions`. I used `character classes` and `quantifiers`, implemented `grouping` and `capturing`, applied assertions and boundaries, and utilized regular expressions for practical applications like validating passwords and URLs. | 
| 20 | LocalStorage and SessionStorage |Today, I learned to use `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for `persistent` and `session-specific` data storage. I practiced saving, retrieving, and removing data from both localStorage and sessionStorage, implemented form data storage, and compared and contrasted the use cases for localStorage and sessionStorage.| 
| 21 | LeetCode Easy  | Today, I solved common LeetCode problems, applying problem-solving skills to implement `algorithms`. I focused on understanding and handling edge cases in algorithmic solutions and gained confidence in tackling easy-level coding challenges on LeetCode.| 
| 22 | LeetCode Medium  | Today, I solved common `medium-level LeetCode problems`, applying advanced problem-solving skills to implement `algorithms`. I focused on understanding and handling edge cases in more complex algorithmic solutions, and I gained confidence in tackling medium-level coding challenges on LeetCode. |
| 23 | LeetCode Hard  | Today, I solved complex LeetCode problems, applying advanced problem-solving skills to implement efficient algorithms. I focused on `understanding` and `handling edge cases` in `hard algorithmic` solutions and gained confidence in tackling hard-level coding challenges on LeetCode. |
| 24 | Project 1 Weather App    | Today, I created a Weather App using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. Upon opening the app, it displays the current weather information for your current location, based on your browser settings. To search for weather information for a different location, you can enter the desired location or city name in the search bar and press Enter. |
