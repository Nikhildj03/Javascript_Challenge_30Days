This is a 30-day challenge to help you learn JavaScript. Each day, you will complete a new challenge that will teach you a new concept or skill.

# **Daily Log**

| Day | Challenge | What I Learned |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Variables and DataTypes | How to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Understand the different data types in JavaScript. Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable. Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
| 2 | Operators | Understanding Operators in JavaScript. Topics Covered: Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, ++, -- Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, >=, <, <= Logical Operators: &&, ||, Ternary Operator: condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse . |
| 3 | Conditional Statement | Understanding Conditional Statement in JavaScript. Topics Covered: `If-else statements`  `Nested if-else` statements `Switch case`  `Ternary operator` Combining conditions   -- . |
| 4 | Loops | Understanding Loops in JavaScript. Topics Covered: `For-loop`  `while-loop`  `Do-while-loop`  `Nested Loop` and also  Understanding and using for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.  Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once . Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems. Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops    | 
| 5 | Functions | Understanding and define `functions` using `function declaration `, `expressions` and `arrow functions`. use `function parameters` and `default values` effectively. create and utilize `higher-order` functions. Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations. Enhances `code reusability` and organization using functions.   |
